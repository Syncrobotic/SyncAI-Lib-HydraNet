# SyncAI CCTV analytics — the plan

Written 2026-08-25, replacing the entire previous documentation set in one file.
Everything it replaces is readable at `git show b7457c2:docs/<file>` (VISION.md, PLAN.md,
METHODOLOGY.md, RETAIL_DATA.md, the journal, and the rest). Where this file cites a
measurement, the provenance is either a config/dataset in this tree or a journal entry at
that commit.

Every number below is **measured** (and says where) or marked **unmeasured**. Nothing here
is an estimate presented as a fact.

Amended the same day after an adversarial self-review; choices made with the user in that
review are marked **decided 2026-08-25** in place.

---

## 1. What this is

A vision system for the **security and retail CCTV analytics domain** — nothing else. It
reads fixed, already-installed store cameras (no LiDAR, no new hardware) and answers two
families of question from the same frames:

* **Security / loss prevention** — who entered where, how many, how long, what did they do,
  did stock leave unpaid.
* **Retail analytics** — footfall, dwell, paths, queues, which display draws attention.

One camera, one model, one export, two readings. The first vertical is an Apple-reseller
chain: white fixtures, glass shopfronts, small high-value devices on open tables — the
environment where generic web-trained models fail hardest.

**Success is one number:** actionable alerts per camera per day, and the incidents missed.
Model metrics (mAP, IoU) are debugging instruments, never the reported result. And no site
figure is an *accuracy* until a human has graded it — until then it is an *agreement* with
the teacher models (§5.5 resolves this via shadow mode).

## 2. The two packages

```
src/syncai_bev3d      runs ONCE per camera, offline    →  camera.json
src/syncai_hydranet   runs EVERY frame, continuous     →  boxes + keypoints → tracks
                                                          in metres → events → alerts
```

The boundary is the load-bearing design decision: **anything constant on a fixed camera is
computed once by `syncai_bev3d` and cached; only what changes frame-to-frame is computed by
`syncai_hydranet`.** The contract between them is one `camera.json` per camera.

**Dependency rule.** Offline code — training, commissioning, campaign tooling — may import
`syncai_bev3d`: the teacher wrappers live there and also feed hydranet's pseudo-label
pipeline (§4.2), so the "once vs every frame" story does not hold at the code level and is
not pretended to. The **serving path must never import it**: at runtime, `camera.json` is
the only thing that crosses the boundary.

Why the boundary sits here — three measurements:

* A trained dense head does not generalise across these cameras: `column` scored 0.86–0.88
  on cameras it trained on and **0.00–0.51 on cameras it never saw**. A commissioning cache
  never has to generalise — it is fitted to its camera by construction.
* The throughput margin is thin: **1,552 fps under TensorRT against the 1,440 target
  (1.08×, measured 2026-08-24)** — engine-only, and with the cheaper terrain head in the
  second slot. Every per-frame head spends this margin; a head whose answer never changes
  spends it on nothing.
* A shared trunk buys a second task for **+3% cost; two separate networks cost +74%**
  (941 vs 541 fps eager, batch 16, 640×1120 FP16). The trunk is worth sharing only between
  tasks that genuinely need to run every frame.

Scale caveat: at ~1,000+ self-installed cameras, per-camera teacher runs stop being
affordable and a generalising segmentation head becomes the right answer. Revisit then.

### 2.1 `syncai_bev3d` — first-pass analysis, calibration, 3D scene

Per camera, once, offline. Target under 20 minutes, of which ~4 are human.

| step | what | human? | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | temporal-median **static plate** — people and moving stock disappear | no | ✅ `scripts/static_plates.py` |
| b | **4+ ground points** on the undistorted plate → homography by least squares. Four is the minimum, not the target: a 4-point fit has zero redundancy and its error grows unquantified toward the frame edges, exactly where speed rules read it | **~4–8 clicks** | ❌ tool to build |
| c | **SAM 3 + Grounding DINO, one pass on the plate** → structure masks: `floor`, `wall`, `column`, `door`, `glass`, `display_table`, `display_shelf` | no | ✅ `tools/site30k/recipe.py` |
| d | **walkable / non-walkable** = floor mask − fixture masks − forbidden zones; indoor/outdoor split is a polygon where a camera sees through the shopfront | no | derived from c |
| e | **zone polygons in metres** — entrance line, till, premium shelf, stockroom door | drawn once | ❌ tool to build |
| f | **shelf ROI list** (from the fixture masks) — drives two-scale product inference (§2.2) | no | derived from c |
| g | **known-false-positive polygons** — derived from the box population, not drawn. Measured: 43.4% of hallucinated `person` boxes come from **37 fixed hotspots** (hanging accessory walls, printed people) across nine cameras | accept / reject | ❌ tool to build; measurement done |
| h | store the plate for **tamper / fixture-change detection** — a knocked camera silently invalidates every metre downstream | no | ❌ |
| i | **3D scene / BEV render** for verification: a 1 m floor grid drawn on a real frame | checked by eye | partial — `geometry/bev3d.py`, `geometry/depth_scene.py` |

Output: `camera.json` — homography, structure masks, walkable polygon, zones in metres,
shelf ROIs, FP polygons, plate reference. Valid until the camera moves **or the store
does**: seasonal display resets invalidate the fixture masks, shelf ROIs and human-drawn
zones while leaving the homography intact. Step (h)'s plate comparison is the trigger;
masks re-run automatically, zones need a human redraw — who owns that loop is open (§7.7).

**Depth lives here, not in a per-frame head.** Every spatial output the product sells
(dwell, paths, heatmaps, queues, zone occupancy) needs *the person's floor position in
metres*, and the homography gives that exactly, in metric units, from 4 clicks. A monocular
depth head gives relative depth at per-frame GPU cost, needs a scale calibration anyway,
and has no right-viewpoint training data.

Code that moves into this package: `geometry/` (bev, bev3d, calibrate, plate_calibration,
ground, depth_scene, meshes, shading, scene_types), `data/teachers/` (sam3, gdino, boxes,
photometry), `scripts/static_plates.py`, the `tools/site30k` recipe.

### 2.2 `syncai_hydranet` — the per-frame network

Trunk, frozen by measurement: **RegNetX-800MF + BiFPN ×2, 96 ch, P3–P7, input 640 × 1120,
FP16.** (64 ch measured slower; input below 640×1120 measured −21% relative site mAP —
boxes under 8 px do not span a stride-8 cell and are unlearnable, not merely hard.)

**Two heads:**

| head | output | status |
|---|---|---|
| **detection** (FCOS) | `person`, `bag`, `device`, `boxed_stock` (+ `stack`, open — §7) | trained today. `device` carries collected-but-merged sub-labels `iphone \| ipad \| macbook` — they stay merged until each sub-class exists on ≥2 test cameras (§4.4), then splitting is a deliberate re-baseline |
| **pose** | 17 keypoints / person | next to land. ViTPose is the offline teacher; measured over 66,599 verified person boxes, **99.9% of people clear the 32 px bottom-up floor** at network scale (median height 178 px) |

**Two-scale inference for small objects:** full frame at 640×1120 for `person`/`bag`/
`stack`; shelf-ROI crops at native 1080p for `device`/`boxed_stock`. The ROIs come free
from commissioning (§2.1f). **Decided 2026-08-25: the ROI path polls at 0.2–1 fps per
camera, not frame rate** — shelf stock is a slow variable and the stock-removal alarm
tolerates tens of seconds of latency. This matters for the budget: the 1.08× throughput
margin was measured **whole-frame only** — the ROI passes were never in it, and at frame
rate they would multiply the per-camera load past the margin. **Unmeasured:** `device` mAP
at native-ROI vs whole-frame, and the ROI path's cost at the chosen cadence — both taken
in gate 3's re-measure.

**No dense segmentation head, no depth head, no behaviour head.** The static structure
those would predict is a per-camera constant (§2.1); single-frame behaviour classification
is ill-posed (walking vs standing is motion, invisible in one frame — and no teacher can
label it from one frame either). Behaviour lands in §2.3.

**The risk the architecture rests on:** distilling top-down ViTPose (per-crop) into a
bottom-up whole-frame head is standard but not free. If it fails, pose becomes a crop-stage
model, L0 has one head, and the honest move is an off-the-shelf detector. Gate 3 in §6
exists to answer this early.

### 2.3 The layers above — where behaviour actually lives

```
L0  pixels  →  boxes + keypoints      hydranet, every frame, GPU
L1  boxes   →  tracks in METRES       tracker + camera.json homography, CPU
L2  tracks  →  per-person facts       crop heads, ~every 3 s per track, GPU
L3  facts   →  events                 rules in metres and seconds, CPU
L4  events  →  judgement              VLM on trigger, GPU queue
```

Two L1 rules that are cheap to write and expensive to discover missing:

* **Floor position is the foot point through the homography — except under fixture
  occlusion.** A person behind a display table has their bbox cut at the table edge; the
  naive foot point lands metres off, and the bias concentrates exactly at the
  highest-value positions (table-edge dwell, shelf reach). When ankle keypoints are
  missing or low-confidence, L1 falls back to head/shoulder keypoints plus a height prior
  — the pose head pays for itself here a second time.
* **The time base is PTS, never frame index.** Measured: every clip in
  `gs://studioa-recording` writes `30/1` into `r_frame_rate` regardless of the true,
  variable rate. Speeds in m/s over nominal fps silently misclassify walk as run on a
  slow stream, and the failure surfaces only as unexplainable run alerts.

* **walk / stand / run** — speed thresholds over L1 tracks. CPU, free, and the thresholds
  are config a manager can change, not classes.
* **sit / crouch / fall** — a <100K-parameter temporal model over pose sequences, CPU.
  Training data is already on disk: **PoseLift** (real retail store, 6 indoor cameras,
  pose sequences + person IDs + frame-level shoplifting labels). **Caveat, unmeasured:**
  PoseLift's sequences came from a different pose estimator whose noise (jitter spectrum,
  occlusion failure modes) differs from our distilled head's; train with noise
  augmentation matched to our head's error profile and measure the transfer after gate 3.
* **loiter, intrusion, line-cross, queue, dwell, tailgating** — rules over tracks in
  metres. `analytics/events/zones.py` is already built this way.
* **intent / concealment** — VLM on trigger only.

Invariants already enforced in the tree: nothing crosses from L3/L4 down into L0, and heads
read only the neck, never each other (`models/hydranet.py`), so `forward` stays pure
convolution and the ONNX/TensorRT export stays clean.

## 3. The requirements → where each one lands

The four capability families this plan must deliver, and their placement:

| requirement | instrument | cost |
|---|---|---|
| walkable / non-walkable area (indoor, outdoor) | `syncai_bev3d` §2.1d, cached mask | once per camera |
| person boxes | detection head | exists |
| floor / column / wall / door / glass / display table / display shelf | `syncai_bev3d` §2.1c, cached masks | once per camera |
| products — iphone / ipad / macbook / boxed-stock | detection head `device` + `boxed_stock`, native-res shelf-ROI crops; sub-labels collected, split when measurable | exists + ROI path unmeasured |
| depth / 3D space | homography + BEV scene (§2.1b, i) — metric, not relative | 4 clicks per camera |
| behaviour: walk / stand / run | L1 speed rules | free, CPU |
| behaviour: sit (+ crouch, fall) | pose head → temporal model on PoseLift | pose is the next head |

The general placement rule, kept from the previous plan because every 2026-08-19/20 mistake
was a violation of it: **for any new capability, walk down from "a config value" and stop
at the first rung that answers it — never start at "a new head".**

## 4. Data — minimum human labelling, teachers do the rest

### 4.1 The onsite corpus

`gs://studioa-recording` — the store's own CCTV. Fleet reality, measured: **48 cameras, 6
emit nothing, 1 mounted sideways, 24 annotated so far.** Two rules with measurements behind
them:

* **More cameras buy generalisation; more frames from the same cameras do not.** The
  2026-08-20 counter-example: 29,211 new frames, 10.4 GPU-hours, zero new cameras, no gain.
* **Viewpoint, not class count, is the bottleneck.** Auto-annotate only our own footage —
  public data already has boxes; in-domain labels are the ones money cannot buy.

### 4.2 The teachers — SAM 3 + Grounding DINO

Both already live in the wheel (`data/teachers/`). Their jobs, in value order:

1. **Commissioning masks** (§2.1c) — per camera, once. A cached artefact, not training data.
2. **Detection pseudo-labels on site footage.** Grounding DINO for `person` (measured
   day:night separation 11–49× against SAM 3's 0.9×); SAM 3 mask → tight box refinement.
   SAM 3 product prompts need adequate resolution — the "0 instances" result was 352×240.
3. **Temporal-consistency filtering** — a box a point tracker follows coherently is real; a
   scattering one is a hallucination. Raw material already on disk:
   `datasets/site30k_v1/annotations/instances_all_*.json` keeps every box to score 0.10,
   no NMS. Zero GPU cost.
4. **Cross-model agreement as confidence:** GDINO + SAM 3 + current student, 2-of-3 →
   **Gold** (full weight); disagreement → **ignore region, never a negative**. The tiering
   pass ran 2026-08-24: Gold verified **60/60 by eye**, and 43.4% of the Gray tier traced
   to the 37 fixed hotspots that become §2.1g's FP polygons.

### 4.3 Supporting datasets

* **On disk, unspent:** `PoseLift` (behaviour model, §2.3); `hm3d_cctv` (synthetic renders
  at the measured store camera pose — geometry and viewpoint, unlimited, exact labels);
  `RAP-v2` (surveillance-domain attributes, for the L2 crop heads later).
* **Worth acquiring, in order:** CEPDOF/HABBOF/WEPDTOF (the only human-labelled overhead
  person data; fisheye — rectify into virtual perspective views), WILDTRACK/MultiviewX
  (ground-truth floor positions — validates L1 geometry without labelling anything), LVIS
  (device-class annotations over COCO images already on disk), SKU-110K (dense box stacks),
  RPC (top-down product appearance).
* **Mixing rule, measured:** the COCO share is a monotonic trade — at `sample_ratio: 0.1`
  detection arrives free; above it, in-domain performance falls monotonically. Public data
  is a low-ratio trunk prior; in-domain is the body.
* **Necessarily in-domain, no public source:** `staff/customer` (3 uniform reference photos
  + per-track VLM voting), `fall`/`crouch` overhead (50–100 staged clips — data generation,
  not annotation). **Open (§7.6):** staged *theft* tests were ruled out 2026-08-25; if
  staging in the store is off the table entirely — off-hours included — fall/crouch has no
  training source and the answer must come from somewhere else.

### 4.4 Split discipline — binds every reported number

Split by **camera**, never by frame. A test camera never supplies a training frame. Every
rare class on ≥2 test cameras, or the number is written "not measured" with the camera
count. One fixed camera is one scene measured N times, not N samples.

### 4.5 Where human labour goes — all of it

4 calibration clicks + zone drawing per camera (§2.1), accept/reject passes on teacher
proposals, and **shadow-mode grading**: the system runs live raising no alerts, an operator
grades what it would have raised. That grading is the human test set — free,
in-distribution, accumulating, and it produces the success number itself.

**Shadow grading measures precision only.** A missed theft never becomes an alert to
grade, so recall has no instrument in that loop. Decided 2026-08-25 (staged in-store
theft tests are not an option): recall is measured by **reconciliation against the
store's shrinkage counts and incident reports**, weekly. The signal is weak and delayed
by weeks — it is also the only one available, so it is reported with that caveat rather
than not at all.

## 5. What it must never do

1. Never put an answer in the weights that belongs in a config.
2. Never let the rule layer reach into the model — "4 minutes is loitering" is an argument.
3. Never report a per-class number resting on one camera.
4. Never buy coverage with more frames from already-annotated cameras.
5. Never infer age/gender on customers; no face recognition; no cross-store tracking.
   `staff/customer` is a uniform, not an identity, and stays in.
6. No SKU-level checkout; no new camera hardware; no per-frame dense scene understanding.

## 6. Build order — one artefact, one gate per step

| # | step | artefact | gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **package split** — create `src/syncai_bev3d`, move the §2.1 code, define the `camera.json` schema; archive non-current configs | two importable packages, green tests | no import cycles; no running training unit touched (check systemd units first) |
| 2 | **commission all 48 cameras** — build the 4-click tool and zone tool, run the pipeline | per-camera `camera.json` + a 1 m grid rendered on one real frame per camera | the grid looks right **to my own eyes on every camera** |
| 3 | **pose head resident** | keypoint error vs ViTPose; throughput re-measured with pose in the slot **and the ROI path at its 0.2–1 fps cadence** | `reach_to_shelf` and `crouch` fire correctly on a watched clip; fps ≥ 1,440 stands with both accounted |
| 4 | **detection uplift at zero GPU** — temporal-consistency tiers from `instances_all_*.json`, FP polygons from the 37 hotspots; **plus the night pass**: measure whether FP polygons + temporal consistency remove the IR ghost persons | new Gold/Silver training set; night `person` precision figure | Gold precision ≥95%, Silver ≥85% on a 300-frame sample; `after_hours_person` stays on the VLM trigger list **only if** the night figure passes |
| 5 | **L1 validation** — homography accuracy against WILDTRACK/MultiviewX ground-truth floor positions; tracking quality (ID switches) on in-domain clips watched end to end | position error in metres; ID-switch count per watched 10-minute clip | position error small enough that zone events land in the right zone; dwell/loiter durations survive — an ID switch mid-loiter resets the clock, so switches on the watched clips must be rare enough not to |
| 6 | **L3 end to end, one camera** | an event log readable against its video | events match what the clip shows |
| 7 | **shadow mode, one store** | alerts/camera/day + operator accept/reject log + **the first shrinkage reconciliation** | single-digit rate; rejects show an actionable pattern |

Throughput ceiling: already passed 2026-08-24 (1,552 fps TRT, batch 16) — but engine-only
and with terrain in slot 2, which is why step 3 re-takes it. Steps 1 and 2 are independent;
nothing after 6 starts until 6 passes, and 6 is not attempted before 5 — an L3 event log
over unvalidated tracks cannot be attributed when it is wrong.

## 7. Open questions — each blocks a specific step

1. **`stack` as a 5th detection class** invalidates checkpoint comparability, and a
   vocabulary change silently empties `analytics/events/zones.py:346`'s default class list
   — the stock-removal alarm stops firing without an exception. Decide at step 4.
2. ~~Night is unscoped~~ — **decided 2026-08-25: night is in v1, gated on a measurement.**
   Step 4 carries the night pass (14 IR ghost persons on one empty frame, measured);
   `after_hours_person` triggers only if the night precision figure passes.
3. **Pose distillation risk** (§2.2) — the claim the two-head architecture rests on.
   Answered by step 3's gate. The scope question above it is settled: **decided
   2026-08-25, fall/second-level behaviour is in v1**, so pose stays a per-frame L0 head.
4. **Delivery target still undefined** — who receives v1, and whether 96 streams/card is
   a requirement or headroom. Changes the commissioning-vs-trained-head threshold (§2).
5. **Retail dashboard surface unscoped** — the numbers fall out of L1 free; what a store
   manager opens, at what cadence, is a product question. Blocks nothing before step 6.
   One modelling gap hides inside it: **store-level footfall needs cross-camera dedup**
   (overlapping views double-count a person). Single-store re-linking is in scope,
   cross-store is banned; the mechanism is unscoped.
6. **Fall/crouch training source** — staged theft tests were ruled out; if in-store
   staging is entirely off the table (off-hours included), the 50–100 staged clips in
   §4.3 have no source. Needs one answer from the store before step 3's events are
   trainable.
7. **Recommissioning ownership** — a seasonal display reset invalidates masks, ROIs and
   zones (§2.1). Plate divergence triggers detection automatically; who redraws the zones
   and approves the new masks is unassigned. Blocks nothing before step 2's rollout, then
   recurs forever.
